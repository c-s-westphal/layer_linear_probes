Linear Probe PCA Experiment

Trains linear probes on PCA-reduced activations from each layer of GPT-2 Small
to predict linguistic features. Measures mutual information and classification
accuracy across layers.

Tasks:
1. Plurality (Binary): Predict if noun is singular or plural
2. Part of Speech (4-class): Predict POS tag (noun/verb/adjective/adverb)

For each layer (1-11, skipping layer 0 input embeddings):
- Extract 768-dim activations at target token positions
- Apply PCA to reduce to 10 principal components
- Train 3 LogisticRegression probes (for confidence intervals)
- Measure mutual information, accuracy, and F1 score
